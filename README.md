## Motivation

The cryptocurrency market is highly sentiment-driven, especially among retail investors who actively use platforms like [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com).  
Understanding user sentiment can help:

- Develop automated trading systems
- Perform real-time market trend analysis
- Track investor psychology at scale

## Problem Statement

**Objective:**  
Accurately classify sentiment (Bullish, Bearish, Neutral) of user-generated posts on StockTwits related to cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu) using a mix of:

- Lexicon-based models
- Classical machine learning classifiers
- Word embeddings
- Transformer-based NLP models

## 💬 Comments and Inline Documentation

All Python files in the  directory are thoroughly documented with:

- **Function-level docstrings** describing inputs, outputs, and logic
- **Inline comments** to explain preprocessing decisions, model configs, and evaluation logic
- **Notebook annotations** for clarity on steps during experimentation

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility

The project is designed for full reproducibility:

-  **`requirements.txt`** to install dependencies
- **Clear `README.md`** (this file) for setup and run instructions
-  **Random seed control** for consistent results
- **notebooks** for reproducible exploratory analysis
